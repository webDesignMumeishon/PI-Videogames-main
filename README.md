# Individual Project -  Videogames

The project consist of calling an API (https://rawg.io/apidocs) to show an initial set of 80 videogames in the /home page to see a variety of items and click over one and access to details about the platforms, genres, name, released date, etc. At the bottom of the page a pagination was created to navigate through the differents games brought by the API called.
In the right side filtering options allow the user to interect with the videogames originally requested. Filtering options by name, rate, genre, and origin (since a videogame can be found the in API or in a Database)
The app has its server from where all the calls are made.
The backend counts with its own database created in postgress, an user can create a new game which will be stored in the database after completing a from located in the /addvideogame route
Hope you like the App!
